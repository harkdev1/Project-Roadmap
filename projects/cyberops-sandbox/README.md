# CyberOps Sandbox

**Main Homelab · In progress** · [Source repository](https://github.com/harkdev1/CyberOps-Sandbox)

A hands-on Windows security homelab built through controlled experiments. The current work studies what Windows Security telemetry actually records, using PowerShell and event logs to validate evidence rather than assume a detection succeeded.

The latest recorded test found that the configured Security log did not reliably expose the process/file activity under investigation. That visibility gap is a finding, not a completed detection capability. The next step is to review audit policy configuration and repeat the controlled tests.

**Main Homelab · Status:** In progress

## What I built
Verified NS-DC01 configuration, confirmed Windows Server 2025 with AD DS and DNS, documented the northstar.local domain and network settings, confirmed VMware NAT mode, identified reusable Project 1 administration and PowerShell capabilities, reviewed Project 2 scope.

Summary:
Current efforts focused on establishing a verified baseline configuration for NS-DC01, documenting its existing state, and identifying reusable administrative assets from Project 1. This foundational work is crucial for preparing the environment for Project 2, with a strong emphasis on preserving current capabilities and avoiding premature changes.

Tasks Completed:
*   Verified and documented the configuration of NS-DC01, confirming it runs Windows Server 2025.
*   Confirmed the presence and configuration of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and DNS roles on NS-DC01.
*   Documented the `northstar.local` domain and its associated network settings.
*   Confirmed VMware NAT network mode is in use for the environment.
*   Identified existing Project 1 administration and PowerShell capabilities with potential for reuse in future projects.
*   Reviewed the high-level scope and requirements for Project 2.

Issues Encountered:
None

Next Steps:
*   Continue analysis of Project 2 requirements against the established baseline to identify integration points and potential impact.
*   Further evaluate the identified reusable Project 1 administrative and PowerShell capabilities for direct application or adaptation in Project 2.
*   Develop a preliminary design or plan for Project 2 that leverages the existing environment without introducing breaking changes.

Notes:
The primary focus of this phase was to meticulously document and understand the current state of the environment, particularly NS-DC01, without making any modifications. This ensures a stable baseline is established before initiating Project 2 activities. A key guiding principle is to preserve existing capabilities and assets from Project 1 wherever possible, streamlining future efforts. This preparatory work is essential for a smooth transition into Project 2 planning and implementation.

## Session highlights

### 2026-10-11 · 10:55 to 11:07
Recorded outcome: ✅ Yes. Current efforts focused on establishing a verified baseline configuration for NS-DC01, documenting its existing state, and identifying reusable administrative assets from Project 1. This foundational work is crucial for preparing the environment for Project 2, with a strong emphasis on preserving current capabilities and avoiding premature changes.

### 2026-10-08 · 05:19 to 05:30
Recorded outcome: ✅ Yes. An initial experimental session was conducted within the CyberOps Sandbox on NS-DC01 to evaluate the reliability of existing Windows Security telemetry in observing intentional, simple process and file activities. The session established that the current Security log configuration does not reliably expose the tested activities, identifying significant visibility gaps. This work underscores a hands-on, experimental methodology focused on understanding and improving telemetry from the ground up, treating failures to observe expected activity as critical engineering findings.
